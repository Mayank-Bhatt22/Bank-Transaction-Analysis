# Bank-Transaction-Analysis
Analyzed a messy banking transaction dataset from Kaggle using SQL. Cleaned NULL values and standardized dates, then applied window functions, aggregations, and conditional logic to study deposits, withdrawals, balance changes, and monthly consistency. Built a rule-based risk scoring model to identify high-risk accounts.
